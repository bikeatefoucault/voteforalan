Over fifteen years as an event production technician has cultivated an ease with mission critical planning, project management, and logistics.

The three years I spent with <a href="http://www.carolinaoptics.com">Carolina Optics</a> as a trainer and technician for several lines of ophthalmic imaging devices refined my ability to adapt delivery of complex subject matter to the needs of the listener.

I have worked climbing cell towers and on the the design and fabrication of implantable neurophysiological recording devices.

I bring together nuanced understanding of the human element and a fearless technical savvy across a multitude of domains.
